Automated ShitBrick-Tool System
==============

A simple console-based tool that checks for the "DevComponents.DotNetBar2.dll" file and if that dynamic link library is not present on you machine it will be downloaded. This is a temporary tool to fix the problem with all of Deavmi's apps (because I always use DotNetBar2).

This tool though is, unlike the original ShitBrick-Tool, an automated version which autmatically runs the fixing process. This is handy for using it with the installers for all of my application that require the ShitBrick library files. This makes the installation easier for the user, so he deosn't have to run ShitBrick manually but it will do it all for him at the beginning of the installation.
