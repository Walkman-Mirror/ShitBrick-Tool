ShitBrick-Tool
==============

A simple console-based tool that checks for the "DevComponents.DotNetBar2.dll" file and if that dynamic link library is not present on you machine it will be downloaded. This is a temporary tool to fix the problem with all of Deavmi's apps (because I always use DotNetBar2).
