Read the description.","body":"# ShitBrick-Tool\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n_A simple console-based tool that checks for the \"DevComponents.DotNetBar2.dll\" file and if that dynamic link library is not present on you machine it will be downloaded. This is a temporary tool to fix the problem with all of Deavmi's apps (because I always use DotNetBar2)._\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Latest stable build\r\n\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.6](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/v1.0.0.6/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n\r\n### Older unstable builds\r\n\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.0](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/v1.0.0.0/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.2](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/v1.0.0.2/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.3](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/v1.0.0.3/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.4](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/v1.0.0.4/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n* [Download ShitBrick-Tool v1.0.0.5](https://github.com/deavmi/ShitBrick-Tool/releases/download/V1.0.0.5/ShitBrick.Tool.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTICE:** We skipped v1.0.0.1 because I forgot to update version number in that release. Therefore that kinda' counts. Yah.\r\n\r\n**NOTICE:** I WILL NEVER AGAIN SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. IT IS NOT USEFUL AT ALL, **EXCEPT** for those that want to fix old versions of my applications.","google":"UA-46364343-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
